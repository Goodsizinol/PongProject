# PongProject
My attempt at making a working version of pong in C++

This project uses the SDL library as well as other basic C++ libraries.

ToDo List:

* Change the design of the program so that it won't use the size of the window for all physics functions
  * Will require a way to convert for the game units to a positon on the screen
* Add a main menu
  * Add an options menu
      * Add custom key binding options
* Modify the "object" class so that objects can be at an angle
* LAN multiplayer (maybe someday)
  * Requires the physics redesign
